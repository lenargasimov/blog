        <h4>My backstory</h4>
        <p>I have always been interested in how websites are created. I always wanted to impress my friends by writing programs, I managed to do this using the Telegram bot in a friendly chat. When I did this, the reverse side of the code struck me. Shortly thereafter, I signed up for a Python programming course at It-Academy. From that moment I fell in love with development. Until fall 2020, I mostly dabbled with Python, around October I started learning web development. The Django framework was opened shortly thereafter, and since then my love for development has skyrocketed. I am currently participating in 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021.</p>
        <h4>So what's next?</h4>
        <p>At the time of this writing of this initial Gist, my goal was to get a job as a Python developer and start developing commercial Python applications, as well as develop a better understanding of Python, and develop a full stack. Although this is a big goal, I am willing to make every effort to achieve this goal.</p>
